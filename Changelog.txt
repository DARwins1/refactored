Changelog:
Refactored v2.5.5

Quick update to resolve issues with Alpha 5.

Changes:
- Updated labels to fix missing south scav base and Hardcrete artifact.

Refactored v2.5.4

Update with bugfixes to work with recent versions.

Changes:
- Mod now comes with its own copy of libcampaign, this should reduce the chances of future updates breaking scripts.
- Updated nexus.js and victory.js to match their modern base counterparts.
- Implemented the improved "Under Attack!" message system from Fractured Kingdom.
- Made propulsions use the new single-model system.
- Updated Super Cyborgs and Cyborg Mechanics to use their modern models.


Refactored v2.5.3

Update with some minor tweaks.

Changes:
- Added various level and scripting improvements from the latest versions of the game.
- Implemented the Beta Final early finish (for all difficulties).
- Gamma 1 now starts the player with Whirlwind tanks instead of Cyclones.
- Pre-placed Flamer Cyborgs in after Beta 4 are now replaced by Thermite Cyborgs.
- Project forces on Beta 2, Gamma 3, Gamma 4, and Gamma 6 now match the player's color instead of always being green.
- NEXUS no longer wipes the player's VTOLs on Gamma Final; if you can get VTOLs anywhere close to that base you probably already deserve a medal.


Changelog:
Refactored v2.5.2

A smaller balance patch and a fix.

Changes:
- Buffed Rocket and Mini-Rocket damage upgrades from +25% to +35% to compensate for the lower amount of upgrades compared to cannons, as well as rockets in MP.
- Finally came to the epiphany that the campaign AI sucked using mobile repair turrets, so all times where the Collective would build Heavy Repair Turrets have been replaced by Infernos.
- The northern tank attack waves in Beta Final now have Sensor units tacked onto the waves, instead of the unit pool containing sensors. Also added a chance for Whirlwinds to be added instead of Sensors.
- Stopped setting a the SW Collective LZ in the main map after Beta 5, since it's never used again and prevents building in that area.
- The above change also removes the no-build zone found in Gamma campaign north of the main LZ after transitioning from Beta. The "No Go" area from Beta Campaign carried over preventing building in that area.


Refactored v2.5.1

A balancing update that reworks a lot of research!

Changes:
- Reduced the production time of normal Cyborgs.
- Nerfed the Heavy Plasma Launcher to match current MP balance.
- Nerfed the scavenger's pit rockets by reducing their ROF but increasing their damage to closer match the default Mini-Rocket Pod.
- Buffed Cyborg alloy upgrades from +30% HP and armor to +35%.
- Buffed Cyborg Thermal Armor upgrades from +40% armor to +45% armor.
- Buffed base structure upgrades from +30% armor to +35% armor.
- Changed all weapon damage upgrades to increase damage by +25%. This is a slight nerf to most weapons overall (from +30% damage), but bombs were buffed substantially (from +10%).
- Recalibrated the cost of the Hyper Velocity Cannon Hardpoint/Emplacement research.
- Made a bunch of things obsolete a bunch of other things. (Tank Killer > Lancer & Mini-Rocket Pod, Cyclone > Hurricane, Assault Gun Tower > Heavy Machinegun Tower, etc.)
- Nerfed the amount of MG and Mortar upgrades the Collective has from Beta 3 to Beta 6.
- Removed a pointless line from the Gamma 1 script.


Refactored v2.5.0

Refactored v2.2.3

Yet another small hotfix, this one fixes a small bug I'm surprised I haven't noticed for so long.

Changes:
- No longer reinforce the player with Heavy Cannon tanks in Beta 1, instead give them HPC tanks.


Refactored v2.2.2

Another hotfix on the same day. Again tackling the root cause of the double-research bug. Turns out it was caused by some extra script files that no longer belonged. Removing those fixed the problem entirely, so I had to un-half the ROF upgrade amounts. Maybe I'm not so smart after all :)

Changes:
- ALL research upgrades should now be equivalent to pre-v2.2.0 effectiveness.


Refactored v2.2.1

Hotfix to quell an issue where Rate-Of-Fire upgrades. For one reason or another, ROF upgrades seemed to apply 2x their intended effect. This would cause situations where weapons would either fire WAY faster than they should or not fire at all because the game couldn't handle a fire delay equal to 0. Solution? Make all ROF upgrades half as effective. I'm such a genius.

Changes:
- ROF upgrades no longer break the game after a certain point. They should now be equivalent to pre-v2.2.0 ROF upgrades in terms of effectiveness.


Refactored v2.2.0

This version is designed for 4.1.3, but should be compatible with any future bugfix updates to the game, assuming no massive changes to libcampaign are made.

Changes:
- Most weapons and bodies have have been updated to 4.1.3 MP balance (excluding the Cyclone and the NEXUS Link Turret).
- Buffed the "damage" of the NEXUS Link Turret.
- Reduced the weight of the Cyclone to match the weight of the Whirlwind.
- Made research logs in the Intelligence Display slightly more informative and accurate to the new balancing.
- Most levels have been left the same as previous versions of Refactored with the following exceptions:

Level Specific Changes:
Alpha 1 (Alpha Base Startup)
- The positions of the Engineering artifact and the Flamer artifact have been swapped (the Flamer is now found in the last base, while Engineering is found in the second).

Alpha 6 (Assault On The Plateau)
- Removed some walls in the northeast NP base.
Beta Final
- Implemented extra attacks from cambalance for harder difficulties.
Gamma 5 (NEXUS Intrusion) and Gamma Final
