Refactored v2.2.1

Hotfix to quell an issue where Rate-Of-Fire upgrades. For one reason or another, ROF upgrades seemed to apply 2x their intended effect. This would cause situations where weapons would either fire WAY faster than they should or not fire at all because the game couldn't handle a fire delay equal to 0. Solution? Make all ROF upgrades half as effective. I'm such a genius.

Changes:
- ROF upgrades no longer break the game after a certain point. They should now be equivalent to pre-v2.2.0 ROF upgrades in terms of effectiveness.


Refactored v2.2.0

This version is designed for 4.1.3, but should be compatible with any future bugfix updates to the game, assuming no massive changes to libcampaign are made.

Changes:
- Most weapons and bodies have have been updated to 4.1.3 MP balance (excluding the Cyclone and the NEXUS Link Turret).
- Buffed the "damage" of the NEXUS Link Turret.

- Most levels have been left the same as previous versions of Refactored with the following exceptions:
