# Refactored
A mod for the WZ 2100 Campaign that aims to bring the Multiplayer and Campaign experience closer together. 

General overview of the large changes:
- Changes the base stats for almost every vehicle component to be identical to Multiplayer.
- Adds extra MP exclusive items into the Campaign, such as the Plasmite Flamer.
- Adds all cyborg varients into the Campaign, including Super Cyborgs.
- Adds Hardcrete Gates into the Campaign (why isn't this already a thing?), and places Hardcrete Gates into every map where they make sense.
- Many artifacts and technologies have been moved around to make progression more logical and useful. For example, the Light Cannon is available earlier to promote it's usefulness, while the Whirlwind AA was pushed back to give the Cyclone more relevancy.
- Many small level script tweaks to account for the changes in weapon balance.
- New unit templates employed by the enemies of the Project.

This mod is fully playable through the entire three campaigns. Hopefully this mod will provide a fun experience for anyone who wants to try it.
